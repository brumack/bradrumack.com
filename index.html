                    Hawkins.png was built for a client of mine who runs a photography editing business.
                    He needed a way to streamline his process of onboarding new clients and providing 
                    editing services through project assignments to his staff of editors. For him I
                    created an SPA that handles file uploads, downloads and permissions management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients are taken through the project creation process by picking packages options and then are prompted
                    to upload their files. A project can then be assigned to an editor, who can download the files, make
                    their edits, and reupload for approval. Upon approval, a notification is sent to the client that they
                    can now download the edited files.

                    ToodFrucks is an SPA with the goal of promoting the food truck industry. Its objective is to give food truck
                    owners the ability to connect with consumers. Through the app, food trucks are able to share their
                    present location and hours, as well as future locations. Consumers are able to locate trucks in their area,
                    and search using keywords or cusine types.
                </p>
                <p>
                   ToodFrucks is in continuous development. Due to the current world conditions, an official launch isn't yet planned, but
                   a demo is available online. You'll find links below that log you in as either a consumer or a merchant. Long-term plans
                   include online ordering, and possibly integration with food delivery services such as Doordash and Postmates.

                    A while ago I started experimenting with automated cryptocurrency trading. I'd frequently build and rebuild bots
                    to try new strategies. I'd make some money, lose some money, and then reevaluate. I went through this process 
                    many times, and grew tired of frequently rewriting code to connect to the Binance API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finally wised up and realized I needed to create my own library that I could simply plug in to my
                    new logic each time. This made rapid itteration much easier, and I finally came up with a winning solution...
                    for only a couple months. Then the market went bear and it was time to hang it up.

                    I have been writing code for over 4 years and I honestly wish I had started sooner. It's definitely
                    my life's calling. I started my own business in summer of 2019 as a web app developer and consultant.
                    I've also recently worked in a live ops role for Doordash, where I developed some significant internal tooling
                    for my team. <br><br> Prior, I worked on a cryptocurrency trading platform as a contract back end engineer. While I've mainly
                    worked in Javascript and Node.js, I'd like to consider myself language-agnostic. I'm happy and eager to
                    teach myself anything I don't already know to get something done and done well.
